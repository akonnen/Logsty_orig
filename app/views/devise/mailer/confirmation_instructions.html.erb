<p>We at Logsty wish to welcome you, <%= @resource.username %>! Yes, we know this is just a pre-written message. But it doesn't mean we don't mean it! Our users are what make Logsty worth running, and we want to thank you for signing up. And to show you how much you mean to us here at Logsty, we are donating one hug to a very, very distraught coder who has quit cold-turkey on his or her two pot a day caffeine habit in your name!</p>

<p>However, we also wish to apologize for making you have to go into your inbox to find this message. We know it's annoying, especially since all you want to do probably is post logs or comment on some log somewhere. However, this is all that sits between Logsty and the evil spambots controlled by that scary lich, and spambots make both our users and us sad. We hope you understand, and again, we are sorry. But good news, you're almost there! Just click the confirmation link below and you'll be confirmed and auto-magically signed in. If you can't click the link or there is no link, feel free to use the contact page on Logsty to shoot us an email and we'll be more than happy to help you out!</p>
